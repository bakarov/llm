Amendment to the Service Agreement Regarding Travel Expenses


This Amendment is part of the Service Agreement (the “Agreement”) entered into between GlobalService LLC, represented by CEO John Doe, and ClientProject Inc., represented by CEO Jane Smith, originally dated [Insert Date of Main Agreement].


Purpose:
To introduce complex multi-factor adjustments to the travel expense policy to accommodate various scenarios affecting travel costs, ensuring fair and efficient management of corporate travel expenses.


1. Amendments to Travel Expense Policy:


1.1 Introduction of Multi-Factor Adjustment Conditions:


        •        Night and Weekend Travel Multiplier:
Travel expenses incurred for flights scheduled between 9:00 PM and 5:00 AM or on weekends (from Friday 9:00 PM to Monday 5:00 AM) will include a multiplier of 1.1 to address the increased costs associated with off-hours travel.
        •        Seasonal and Location-Based Adjustments:
For travel during designated peak seasons (including Christmas, New Year, and national holidays in the destination country) and to high-cost locations (as predefined in the corporate travel policy), an additional multiplier of 1.2 will be applied to the standard travel budget.
        •        Urgency and Unscheduled Travel Surge Pricing:
If travel is necessitated with less than 48 hours notice, a surge pricing multiplier of 1.3 will be applied, reflecting the higher costs associated with last-minute travel arrangements.


1.2 Example for Application of Multi-Factor Adjustments:
Consider an urgent business requirement necessitates travel to New York City over New Year’s weekend, with flight booking required on a Friday night. If the base approved travel budget is $2,500, the applicable adjustments would be:


        •        Night and Weekend Travel Multiplier: 1.1
        •        Seasonal and Location Adjustment for New York during New Year: 1.2
        •        Urgency Multiplier for last-minute booking: 1.3
The total allowable expense for this travel scenario would be $2,500 * 1.1 * 1.2 * 1.3 = $4,158.


2. Enforcement and Compliance:
Failure to comply with the stipulated adjustment rules will be considered a violation of the corporate travel policy, subject to disciplinary actions and potential financial repercussions as outlined in the main Agreement.
